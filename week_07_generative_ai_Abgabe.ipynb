        "In previous tasks, we solved classification problems - we provide some input(s), typically an image, and get out a few numbers, which are the predicted pseudo-probabilities that our input belongs to some class, such as \"tumor\" or \"no tumor\". For this exercise, we will explore a new task that is extremely common in medical AI research and in clinical practice. This task is called segmentation. In segmentation, the goal is to go from an input image to one or several segmentations (also called *segmentation maps*) of that image. For the example of LiTS, this means that our input remains the same - a 256x256 image with 1 channel. However, our model outputs and targets are now different - they also have the shape 256x256 pixels, times the number of output classes, in our case 3 (background, liver, liver+tumor). Each 256x256 output is basically a map of which pixels in the original image belong to a certain class with what (pseudo-)probability. The training objective, in its simplest form, is also the same; Cross-Entropy Loss, but per pixel, instead of per-image."

Every pixel is assigned a class, which can be 0 for background, 1 for liver, and 2 for lesions. The corresponding tensor has the size $H * W$. One-hot encoded targets instead have size $C * H * W$ - each channel is one class (the 0th channel is background, etc.), and the values for each pixel in a channel are 1 if that pixel belongs to that class and 0 if not. We will need both later on - class-index targets because that is the input for the normal CrossEntropyLoss, and one-hot targets because we will use them in this format for our DiceLoss.\n",
